### Example: Poisson Distribution

#### Problem:
A customer service center receives an average of 4 calls per hour. Using the **Poisson distribution**, calculate the following probabilities:
1. No calls in an hour (\(P(X = 0)\)).
2. Exactly 3 calls in an hour (\(P(X = 3)\)).
3. At least 2 calls in an hour (\(P(X \geq 2)\)).
4. Less than 3 calls in an hour (\(P(X < 3)\)).

---

### **Step 1: Poisson Distribution Formula**
The **Poisson probability mass function** is given by:

$$
P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
$$

Where:
- \(X\) is the number of events (e.g., calls received),
- \(\lambda\) is the average number of events in a given time interval (mean rate, 4 calls/hour in this example),
- \(k\) is the number of events we want the probability for.

---

### **Step 2: Solve Each Probability**

#### **1. Probability of No Calls (\(P(X = 0)\)):**

Using \(\lambda = 4\) and \(k = 0\):
$$
P(X = 0) = \frac{4^0 e^{-4}}{0!} = \frac{1 \cdot e^{-4}}{1} = e^{-4}
$$

Numerically:
$$
P(X = 0) = e^{-4} \approx 0.0183
$$

---

#### **2. Probability of Exactly 3 Calls (\(P(X = 3)\)):**

Using \(\lambda = 4\) and \(k = 3\):
$$
P(X = 3) = \frac{4^3 e^{-4}}{3!} = \frac{64 \cdot e^{-4}}{6}
$$

Numerically:
$$
P(X = 3) = \frac{64 \cdot 0.0183}{6} \approx 0.1954
$$

---

#### **3. Probability of At Least 2 Calls (\(P(X \geq 2)\)):**

The complement of \(P(X < 2)\) gives:
$$
P(X \geq 2) = 1 - P(X < 2)
$$
Where:
$$
P(X < 2) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1)
$$

For \(P(X = 1)\), use \(\lambda = 4\) and \(k = 1\):
$$
P(X = 1) = \frac{4^1 e^{-4}}{1!} = \frac{4 \cdot e^{-4}}{1} = 4 \cdot 0.0183 \approx 0.0733
$$

Thus:
$$
P(X < 2) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) = 0.0183 + 0.0733 = 0.0916
$$
And:
$$
P(X \geq 2) = 1 - 0.0916 = 0.9084
$$

---

#### **4. Probability of Less Than 3 Calls (\(P(X < 3)\)):**

$$
P(X < 3) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)
$$

For \(P(X = 2)\), use \(\lambda = 4\) and \(k = 2\):
$$
P(X = 2) = \frac{4^2 e^{-4}}{2!} = \frac{16 \cdot e^{-4}}{2} = 8 \cdot 0.0183 \approx 0.1464
$$

Thus:
$$
P(X < 3) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)
$$
$$
P(X < 3) = 0.0183 + 0.0733 + 0.1464 = 0.2380
$$

---

### **Summary of Results:**

1. **No calls (\(P(X = 0)\))**:
   $$
   P(X = 0) \approx 0.0183
   $$

2. **Exactly 3 calls (\(P(X = 3)\))**:
   $$
   P(X = 3) \approx 0.1954
   $$

3. **At least 2 calls (\(P(X \geq 2)\))**:
   $$
   P(X \geq 2) \approx 0.9084
   $$

4. **Less than 3 calls (\(P(X < 3)\))**:
   $$
   P(X < 3) \approx 0.2380
   $$
